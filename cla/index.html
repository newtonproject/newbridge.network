This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Newton Project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.</p><p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Newton Project. Except for the license granted herein to Newton Project and recipients of software distributed by Newton Project, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.</p><h2 id=1-definitions>1. Definitions
<a class=anchor href=#1-definitions>#</a></h2><p>&ldquo;You&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Your&rdquo;) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Newton Project.

For the purposes of this definition, &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Newton Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Newton Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as &ldquo;Not a Contribution.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=2-grant-of-copyright-license>2.

<a class=anchor href=#3-grant-of-patent-license>#</a></h2><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Newton Project and to recipients of software distributed by Newton Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p><h2 id=4-authorization>4.
