The fee is calculated according to the following rules: from Ethereum to NewChain, the fee is double the ETH transfer fee and double the NEW transfer fee; from NewChain to Ethereum, the fee is double the NEW transfer fee and double the ETH transfer fee. In the case of ERC20/NRC6 type of pass, the transfer fee is calculated by converting the market price to the pass principal. Due to the volatility of the market, there may be deviations, NewBridge will adjust the fees from time to time, NewBridge itself does not earn any fees from users.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/hello/','title':"Hello",'section':"Home",'content':"What is NewBridge? #  NewBridge has implemented exchange the assets from NewChain to Other blockchain with cross-chain technology, It has supported NEW, USDT, ETH between Ethereum and NewChain, and more assets are coming soon!\nWhat can NewBridge do for you? #  NewBridge has implemented exchange the assets from NewChain to Other blockchain with cross-chain technology, You can transfer your ETH from Ethereum to NewChain, and use the NETH join Newton\u0026rsquo;s ecology, For example: You can lock your NETH and NUSDT in NewSwap for earn transaction fee; you can also transfer you NEW from NewChain to Ethereum, and join the Ethereum ecology by WNEW and so on\u0026hellip;\nNewBridge Users Guide. #  Requirements:\n  Browser User: You should install the NewMask plugin.
